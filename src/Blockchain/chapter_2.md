# Proof Of Work
Since The bank system can say no for some transactions to take place. So we want something that is decentralised .

Thats where Digital token transfer comes in.

But before we create our decentralised Digital token transfer there some potential problems  we need to solve.

1. Intercept transfer and steal funds.- we realy dont want that to happen.(security)

2. Spend money without authorization.- We need to make sure that if its Alice doing the transaction she is realy her doing it.

3. Double spending. -
