# Proof Of Work
Since The bank system can say no for some transactions to take place. So we want something that is decentralised .

Thats where Digital token transfer comes in.

But before we create our decentralised Digital token transfer there some potential problems  we need to solve.

1. Intercept transfer and steal funds.- we realy dont want that to happen.(security)

2. Spend money without authorization.- We need to make sure that if its Alice doing the transaction she is realy her doing it.

3. Double spending. -   The thing with digital token transfer money can be replicated. so you need to ensure once a token has been spent cannot  be  spent again.
 
4. Equivocate -Once a spend happens it cannot be retaken back.

##### What features we want in a decentralised cryptocurrency?

a.) Anyone can use it - permissionless
b.) Authoratative transfer - No double spending 
c.)  cant undo spends - Tamper proof
