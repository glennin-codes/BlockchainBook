*In laymans language* :Blockchain is an ever-growing ,secure ,shared recordkeeping system in which each user of the data holds a copy of the records,which can only be updated if majority of the transaction agree to update.

*In Technical Defination* : Blockchain is a `peer to peer` ,`distrubuted ledger` that is `cryptographically secure`,`append-only`,immutable(extremely hard to chainge),and `updateable only via consensus` among peers.
