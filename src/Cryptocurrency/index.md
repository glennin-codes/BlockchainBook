**Origin of Money** :The origin of money cames about buy so many theories.The most of which we gonna talk about is the  ``coincidence of wants`` and something later happened.
Before money was invented ,there goes Bob who has Maize but he needs Rice today for his supper.He goes by to Alice who has Rice but would need some Maize to feed  her chickens.So they will do barter.

But again another scenario arises where Bob doesnt need Rice from Alice but needs something else from her and Alice now needs something else too but not Bob`s Maize .NOW the coincidence of events or wants differs.Thus they came up with money which was rare ,had value and was not easy  to  reproduce .In order to complete their exchanges.

**Why does money has value?**
Money has value because we all think it has value.We have all decided they are valueable.If you have a dollar bill and you wanna buy something or exchange something from someone ,they gonna take it,and they know someone else is gonna take it.Its a collective story that we all tell.
